<p>TLDR; The authors propose a new architecture called &quot;Pointer Network&quot;. A Pointer Network is a seq2seq architecture with attention mechanism where the output vocabulary is the set of input indices. Since the output vocabulary varies based on input sequence length, a Pointer Network can generalize to variable-length inputs. The attention method trough which this is achieved is O(n^2), and only a sight variation of the standard seq2seq attention mechanism. The authors evaluate the architecture on tasks where the outputs correspond to positions of the inputs: Convex Hull, Delaunay Triangulation and Traveling Salesman problems. The architecture performs well these, and generalizes to sequences longer than those found in the training data.</p>
<h4 id="key-points">Key Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>Similar to standard attention, but don't blend the encoder states, use the attention vector directory.</li>
<li>Softmax probabilities of outputs can be interpreted as a fuzzy pointer.</li>
<li>We can solve the same problem artificially using seq2seq and outputting &quot;coordinates&quot;, but that ignores the output constraints and would be less efficient.</li>
<li>512 unit LSTM, SGD with LR 1.0, batch size of 128, L2 gradient clipping of 2.0.</li>
<li>In the case of TSP, the &quot;student&quot; networks outperforms the &quot;teacher&quot; algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notes-questions">Notes/ Questions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Seems like this architecture could be applied to generating spans (as in the newer &quot;Text Processing From Bytes&quot; paper), for POS tagging for example. That would require outputting classes in addition to input pointers. How?</li>
</ul>
