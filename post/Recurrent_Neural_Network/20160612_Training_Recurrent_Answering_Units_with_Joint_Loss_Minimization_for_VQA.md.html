<p>TLDR: They propose a novel algorithm for visual question answering based on a recurrent deep neural network, where every module in the network corresponds to a complete answering unit with attention mechanism by itself. The motivation behind their work is the observation that solving a task defined by a question often requires the capability to solve a sequence of atomic subtasks.</p>
