<p>TLDR: Attention mechanisms have recently been introduced in deep learning for various tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. But despite their popularity, the “correctness” of the implicitly-learned attention maps has only been assessed qualitatively by visualization of several examples. In this paper we focuson evaluating and improving the correctness of attention in neural image captioning models.</p>
