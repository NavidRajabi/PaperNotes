<p>This paper presents a multi-layered QA architecture suitable for enhancing current QA capabilities with the <span style="color:red">possibility of processing complex questions</span>.</p>
<p>That is, questions whose answer needs to be gathered from pieces of factual information scattered in different documents.</p>
<p>Specifically, they have designed a layer oriented to process the different types of temporal questions. Complex temporal questions are first decomposed into simpler ones, according to the temporal relationships expressed in the original question.</p>
<p>In the same way, the answers of each simple question are re-composed, fulfilling the temporal restrictions of the original complex question.</p>
<h2 id="architecture-of-a-question-answering-system-applied-to-temporality">Architecture of a Question Answering System applied to Temporality</h2>
<p>The main components of the Temporal Question Answering System are top-down: Question Decomposition Unit, General purpose Q.A. system and Answer, Recomposition Unit.</p>
