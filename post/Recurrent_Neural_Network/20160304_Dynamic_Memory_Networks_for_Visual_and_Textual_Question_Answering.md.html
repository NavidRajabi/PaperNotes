<h1 id="introduction">Introduction}</h1>
<p>Neural network based methods have made tremendous progress in image and text classification (<a href="">&quot;Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks,Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank&quot;</a>). However, only recently has progress been made on more complex tasks that require logical reasoning. This success is based in part on the addition of memory and attention components to complex neural networks. For instance, memory networks (<a href="">&quot;Towards ai-complete question answering: {A} set of prerequisite toy tasks&quot;</a>) are able to reason over several facts written in natural language or (subject, relation, object) triplets. Attention mechanisms have been successful components in both machine translation (<a href="">&quot;Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate,Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation&quot;</a>) and image captioning models (<a href="">&quot;Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>The dynamic memory network (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>) (DMN) is one example of a neural network model that has both a memory component and an attention mechanism. The DMN yields state of the art results on question answering with supporting facts marked during training, sentiment analysis, and part-of-speech tagging. %Its main idea is to use a question to selectively pay attention to textual inputs. These inputs are then given to an episodic memory module which collects the relevant inputs in order to give an answer. %The memory module has two important steps: (1) computing attention gates to focus on particular facts given a question and (2) updating the memory by reasoning over the attended facts.</p>
<p>We analyze the DMN components, specifically the input module and memory module, to improve question answering. We propose a new input module which uses a two level encoder with a sentence reader and input fusion layer to allow for information flow between sentences. For the memory, we propose a modification to gated recurrent units (GRU) (<a href="">&quot;Empirical evaluation of gated recurrent neural networks on sequence modeling&quot;</a>). The new GRU formulation incorporates attention gates that are computed using global knowledge over the facts. Unlike before, the new DMN+ model does not require that supporting facts (i.e. the facts that are relevant for answering a particular question) are labeled during training. The model learns to select the important facts from a larger set.</p>
<p>In addition, we introduce a new input module to represent images. This module is compatible with the rest of the DMN architecture and its output is fed into the memory module. We show that the changes in the memory module that improved textual question answering also improve visual question answering. Both tasks are illustrated in Fig.~. %The improved DMN+ architecture obtains a new level of state of the art performance on both modalities.</p>
<h1 id="dynamic-memory-networks">Dynamic Memory Networks}</h1>
<p>We begin by outlining the DMN for question answering and the modules as presented in (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>The DMN is a general architecture for question answering (QA). It is composed of modules that allow different aspects such as input representations or memory components to be analyzed and improved independently. The modules, depicted in Fig.~, are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Input Module}\)</span>:</p>
<p>This module processes the input data about which a question is being asked into a set of vectors termed facts, represented as <span class="math inline">\(F=[f_1,\hdots,f_N]\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the total number of facts. These vectors are ordered, resulting in additional information that can be used by later components. For text QA in (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>), the module consists of a GRU over the input words. %To process different input formats, the module can be substituted.</p>
<p>As the GRU is used in many components of the DMN, it is useful to provide the full definition. For each time step <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with input <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and previous hidden state <span class="math inline">\(h_{i-1}\)</span>, we compute the updated hidden state <span class="math inline">\(h_i = GRU(x_i,h_{i-1})\)</span> by %The internal mechanics of a GRU with an input <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and a previous hidden state <span class="math inline">\(h_{i-1}\)</span>, the updated hidden state <span class="math inline">\(h_i = GRU(x_i,h_{i-1})\)</span> is computed by <span class="math display">\[
u_i &amp;=&amp; \sigma\left(W^{(u)}x_{i} + U^{(u)} h_{i-1}  + b^{(u)} \right)\label{eq:gru-update}\\
r_i &amp;=&amp; \sigma\left(W^{(r)}x_{i} + U^{(r)} h_{i-1} + b^{(r)} \right)\\
\tilde{h}_i &amp;=&amp;  \tanh\left(Wx_{i} + r_i \circ U h_{i-1}  + b^{(h)}\right)\\
h_i &amp;=&amp;  u_i\circ \tilde{h}_i + (1-u_i) \circ h_{i-1}\label{eq:gru-hidden}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the sigmoid activation function, <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> is an element-wise product, <span class="math inline">\(W^{(z)}, W^{(r)}, W \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H \times n_I}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U^{(z)}, U^{(r)}, U \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H \times n_H}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_H\)</span> is the hidden size, and <span class="math inline">\(n_I\)</span> is the input size.</p>
<p>%For text QA, the module consists of either gated recurrent units (GRUs) or a simpler positional encoding scheme over the input sentences. %For visual QA, we show that a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach can be used, as described in Section . %Input modules may use knowledge stores (referred to as semantic memory modules) to preprocess the input, such as a collection of word vectors, gazeteers, or relational triplets.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Question Module}\)</span>: This module computes a vector representation <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> of the question, where <span class="math inline">\(q \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H}\)</span> is the final hidden state of a GRU over the words in the question. %This output is used by the rest of the network to decide which inputs are relevant.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Episodic Memory Module}\)</span>: Episode memory aims to retrieve the information required to answer the question <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> from the input facts. To improve our understanding of both the question and input, especially if questions require transitive reasoning, the episode memory module may pass over the input multiple times, updating episode memory after each pass. We refer to the episode memory on the <span class="math inline">\(t^{th}\)</span> pass over the inputs as <span class="math inline">\(m^t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m^t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H}\)</span>, the initial memory vector is set to the question vector: <span class="math inline">\(m^0 = q\)</span>. %We refer to the episode memory on the <span class="math inline">\(t^{th}\)</span> pass as <span class="math inline">\(m^t\)</span>. % Caiming - The meaning of a book will become clear if you read it many times - from a Chinese saying %The episodic memory module is responsible for repeatedly accessing the hidden states for each of the input facts <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and updating the episodic memory state <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> depending on both <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and the contextual information retrieved so far. % aggregate, repeated for improvements %The episodic memory state can initially be set to any value but we use the question vector <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> itself.</p>
<p>The episodic memory module consists of two separate components: the attention mechanism and the memory update mechanism. The attention mechanism is responsible for producing a contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c^t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H}\)</span> is a summary of relevant input for pass <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, with relevance inferred by the question <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and previous episode memory <span class="math inline">\(m^{t-1}\)</span>. %The attention mechanism is responsible for producing a contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span> is a vector representation of aggregating the relevant facts % Give an example? The memory update mechanism is responsible for generating the episode memory <span class="math inline">\(m^t\)</span> based upon the contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span> and previous episode memory <span class="math inline">\(m^{t-1}\)</span>. %This process is iterative and allows for transitive reasoning, retrieving and focusing on facts that were irrelevant in previous passes. By the final pass <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, the episodic memory <span class="math inline">\(m^T\)</span> should contain all the information required to answer the question <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>$: The answer module receives both <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m^T\)</span> to generate the model's predicted answer. For simple answers, such as a single word, a linear layer with softmax activation may be used. For tasks requiring a sequence output, an RNN may be used to decode <span class="math inline">\(a = [q ; m^T]\)</span>, the concatenation of vectors <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m^T\)</span>, to an ordered set of tokens. The cross entropy error on the answers is used for training and backpropagated through the entire network.</p>
<h1 id="improved-dynamic-memory-networks-dmn">Improved Dynamic Memory Networks: DMN+}</h1>
<p>We propose and compare several modeling choices for two crucial components: input representation, attention mechanism and memory update. The final DMN+ model obtains the highest accuracy on the -10k dataset without supporting facts and the VQA dataset ([&quot;Antol2015}. Several design choices are motivated by intuition and accuracy improvements on that dataset. %An example of an (input, question, answer) triplet from is given in Fig.~.</p>
<h2 id="input-module-for-text-qa">Input Module for Text QA} </h2>
<p>In the DMN specified in (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>), a single GRU is used to process all the words in the story, extracting sentence representations by storing the hidden states produced at the end of sentence markers. The GRU also provides a temporal component by allowing a sentence to know the content of the sentences that came before them. %The drawback to this approach is that each word of the story must be processed sequentially, resulting in slow speeds if there are either many words or many sentences. %A drawback to this approach is that a sentence does not know the content of any sentences that come after it. Whilst this input module worked well for -1k with supporting facts, as reported in (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>), it did not perform well on -10k without supporting facts (Sec. ).</p>
<p>%As noted in the DMN paper, the GRU is responsible for two complex and different tasks - generating the sentence embedding from the words and allowing interactions between distant sentences by propagating information. We speculate that there are two main reasons for this performance disparity, all exacerbated by the removal of supporting facts. First, the GRU only allows sentences to have context from sentences before them, but not after them. This prevents information propagation from future sentences. Second, the supporting sentences may be too far away from each other on a word level to allow for these distant sentences to interact through the word level GRU.</p>
<p>$ </p>
<p>For the DMN+, we propose replacing this single GRU with two different components. The first component is a sentence reader, responsible only for encoding the words into a sentence embedding. The second component is the input fusion layer, allowing for interactions between sentences. This resembles the hierarchical neural auto-encoder architecture of (<a href="">&quot;A Hierarchical Neural Autoencoder for Paragraphs and Documents&quot;</a>) and allows content interaction between sentences. We adopt the bi-directional GRU for this input fusion layer because it allows information from both past and future sentences to be used. As gradients do not need to propagate through the words between sentences, the fusion layer also allows for distant supporting sentences to have a more direct interaction.</p>
<p>%The sentence reader could be a variety of encoding schemes, such as GRUs, LSTMs, bag-of-words, and the positional encoding scheme described in ([&quot;Sukhbaatar2015}. The sentence reader could be based on any variety of encoding schemes. We selected positional encoding described in ([&quot;Sukhbaatar2015} to allow for a comparison to their work. GRUs and LSTMs were also considered but required more computational resources and were prone to overfitting if auxiliary tasks, such as reconstructing the original sentence, were not used.</p>
<p>For the positional encoding scheme, the sentence representation is produced by <span class="math inline">\(f_i = \sum^{j=1}_M l_j \circ w^i_j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> is element-wise multiplication and <span class="math inline">\(l_j\)</span> is a column vector with structure <span class="math inline">\(l_{jd} = (1 - j / M) - (d / D) (1 - 2j / M)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the embedding index and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the dimension of the embedding.</p>
<p>%Sentences are encoded by <span class="math inline">\(\overrightarrow{w^i_j} = GRU(w^i_j, \overrightarrow{w^i_{j-1}})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\overrightarrow{w^i_j}\)</span> is the GRU hidden state at time <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w^i_j\)</span> is the input word at timestep <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. %We take <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> as the final hidden state of the GRU, <span class="math inline">\(\overrightarrow{w^i_{M_i}}\)</span>. %, where <span class="math inline">\(M_i\)</span> is the number of words in the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> sentence.</p>
<p>The input fusion layer takes these input facts and enables an information exchange between them by applying a bi-directional GRU. <span class="math display">\[
\overrightarrow{f_i} = GRU_{fwd}(f_i, \overrightarrow{f_{i-1}}) \\
\overleftarrow{f_{i}} = GRU_{bwd}(f_{i}, \overleftarrow{f_{i+1}}) \\
\overleftrightarrow{f_i} = \overleftarrow{f_i} + \overrightarrow{f_i}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span> is the input fact at timestep <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, $ $ is the hidden state of the forward GRU at timestep <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\overleftarrow{f_i}\)</span> is the hidden state of the backward GRU at timestep <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. This allows contextual information from both future and past facts to impact <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{f_i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We explored a variety of encoding schemes for the sentence reader, including GRUs, LSTMs, and the positional encoding scheme described in (<a href="">&quot;End-to-end memory networks&quot;</a>). For simplicity and speed, we selected the positional encoding scheme. GRUs and LSTMs were also considered but required more computational resources and were prone to overfitting if auxiliary tasks, such as reconstructing the original sentence, were not used.</p>
<h2 id="input-module-for-vqa">Input Module for VQA} </h2>
<p>To apply the DMN to visual question answering, we introduce a new input module for images. The module splits an image into small local regions and considers each region equivalent to a sentence in the input module for text. The input module for VQA is composed of three parts, illustrated in Fig.~: local region feature extraction, visual feature embedding, and the input fusion layer introduced in Sec.~.</p>
<p>$ To extract features from the image, we use a convolutional neural network (<a href="">&quot;Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks&quot;</a>) based upon the VGG-19 model ([&quot;simonyan2014very}. We first rescale the input image to <span class="math inline">\(448 \times 448\)</span> and take the output from the last pooling layer which has dimensionality <span class="math inline">\(d = 512 \times 14 \times 14\)</span>. The pooling layer divides the image into a grid of <span class="math inline">\(14 \times 14\)</span>, resulting in 196 local regional vectors of <span class="math inline">\(d = 512\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Visual feature embedding:} As the VQA task involves both image features and text features, we add a linear layer with tanh activation to project the %\)</span>d = 512$ local regional vectors to the textual feature space used by the question vector <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>
<p>$ The local regional vectors extracted from above do not yet have global information available to them. Without global information, their representational power is quite limited, with simple issues like object scaling or locational variance causing accuracy problems.</p>
<p>To solve this, we add an input fusion layer similar to that of the textual input module described in Sec.~. First, to produce the input facts <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, we traverse the image in a snake like fashion, as seen in Figure . We then apply a bi-directional GRU over these input facts <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to produce the globally aware input facts <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{F}\)</span>. The bi-directional GRU allows for information propagation from neighboring image patches, capturing spatial information. %As the bi-directional GRU is one dimensional and the original image 2D, some spatial information may be difficult to capture.</p>
<h2 id="the-episodic-memory-module">The Episodic Memory Module}</h2>
<p>The episodic memory module, as depicted in Fig.~, retrieves information from the input facts <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{F} = [\overleftrightarrow{f_1}, \hdots, \overleftrightarrow{f_N}]\)</span> provided to it by focusing attention on a subset of these facts. We implement this attention by associating a single scalar value, the attention gate <span class="math inline">\(g^t_i\)</span>, with each fact <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{f}_i\)</span> during pass <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This is computed by allowing interactions between the fact and both the question representation and the episode memory state.  <span class="math display">\[
z^t_i &amp;=&amp; [\overleftrightarrow{f_i} \circ q; \overleftrightarrow{f_i} \circ m^{t-1}; \lvert \overleftrightarrow{f_i} - q \rvert; \lvert \overleftrightarrow{f_i} - m^{t-1} \rvert]\label{eq:z} \\
Z^t_i &amp;=&amp; W^{(2)} \tanh\left(W^{(1)}z^t_i + b^{(1)} \right)+ b^{(2)} \\
g^t_i &amp;=&amp; \frac{\exp(Z^t_i)}{\sum_{k=1}^{M_i} \exp(Z^t_k)} \label{eq:attn-gate}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{f_i}\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> fact, <span class="math inline">\(m^{t-1}\)</span> is the previous episode memory, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the original question, <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> is the element-wise product, <span class="math inline">\(|\cdot|\)</span> is the element-wise absolute value, and <span class="math inline">\(;\)</span> represents concatenation of the vectors.</p>
<p>The DMN implemented in ([&quot;Kumar2015} involved a more complex set of interactions within <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, containing the additional terms <span class="math inline">\([f; m^{t-1}; q; f^T W^{(b)} q; f^T W^{(b)} m^{t-1}]\)</span>. After an initial analysis, we found these additional terms were not required.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>Once we have the attention gate <span class="math inline">\(g^t_i\)</span> we use an attention mechanism to extract a contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span> based upon the current focus. We focus on two types of attention: soft attention and a new attention based GRU. The latter improves performance and is hence the final modeling choice for the DMN+.</p>
<p>$ Soft attention produces a contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span> through a weighted summation of the sorted list of vectors <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{F}\)</span> and corresponding attention gates <span class="math inline">\(g_i^t\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(c^t = \sum_{i=1}^N g^t_i \overleftrightarrow{f}_i\)</span> This method has two advantages. First, it is easy to compute. Second, if the softmax activation is spiky it can approximate a hard attention function by selecting only a single fact for the contextual vector whilst still being differentiable. However the main disadvantage to soft attention is that the summation process loses both positional and ordering information. Whilst multiple attention passes can retrieve some of this information, this is inefficient.</p>
<p>$  For more complex queries, we would like for the attention mechanism to be sensitive to both the position and ordering of the input facts <span class="math inline">\(\overleftrightarrow{F}\)</span>. An RNN would be advantageous in this situation except they cannot make use of the attention gate from Equation .</p>
<p>We propose a modification to the GRU architecture by embedding information from the attention mechanism. The update gate <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> in Equation  decides how much of each dimension of the hidden state to retain and how much should be updated with the transformed input <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> from the current timestep. As <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> is computed using only the current input and the hidden state from previous timesteps, it lacks any knowledge from the question or previous episode memory.</p>
<p>By replacing the update gate <span class="math inline">\(u_i\)</span> in the GRU (Equation ) with the output of the attention gate <span class="math inline">\(g^t_i\)</span> (Equation ) in Equation , the GRU can now use the attention gate for updating its internal state. This change is depicted in Fig~. %As the input to the update gate can have additional context, we speculate it allows better informed update decisions. <span class="math display">\[
h_i &amp;=&amp;  g^t_i \circ \tilde{h}_i + (1-g^t_i) \circ h_{i-1}
\]</span> An important consideration is that <span class="math inline">\(g^t_i\)</span> is a scalar, generated using a softmax activation, as opposed to the vector <span class="math inline">\(u_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H}\)</span>, generated using a sigmoid activation. This allows us to easily visualize how the attention gates activate over the input, later shown for visual QA in Fig.~. %It would also allow for supporting fact supervision if it is provided by the dataset. Though not explored, replacing the softmax activation in Equation  with a sigmoid activation would result in <span class="math inline">\(g^t_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H}\)</span>. % SPACE than that of the GRU's original update gate. %Finally, the attention based GRU can now take positional and ordering information of facts into account, which the soft attention model cannot do. % Space saving To produce the contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span> used for updating the episodic memory state <span class="math inline">\(m^t\)</span>, we use the final hidden state of the attention based GRU.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>After each pass through the attention mechanism, we wish to update the episode memory <span class="math inline">\(m^{t-1}\)</span> with the newly constructed contextual vector <span class="math inline">\(c^t\)</span>, producing <span class="math inline">\(m^t\)</span>. In the DMN, a GRU with the initial hidden state set to the question vector <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is used for this purpose. %TODO should we add this somewhere higher up? The episodic memory for pass <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is computed by <span class="math display">\[
m^t = GRU(c^t, m^{t-1})
\]</span></p>
<p>The work of ([&quot;Sukhbaatar2015} suggests that using different weights for each pass through the episodic memory may be advantageous. When the model contains only one set of weights for all episodic passes over the input, it is referred to as a $, as in the ``Mem Weights'' row in Table~.</p>
<p>%For untied experiments where each pass through the episodic memory module has independent weights, the GRU makes less sense for memory updates. %TODO not sure here. why?</p>
<p>Following the memory update component used in (<a href="">&quot;End-to-end memory networks&quot;</a>) and (<a href="">&quot;Towards neural network-based reasoning&quot;</a>) we experiment with using a ReLU layer for the memory update, calculating the new episode memory state by <span class="math display">\[
m^t = ReLU\left(W^t [m^{t-1} ; c^t ; q] + b\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(;\)</span> is the concatenation operator, <span class="math inline">\(W^t \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H \times n_H}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b \in \mathbb{R}^{n_H}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n_H\)</span> is the hidden size. The untying of weights and using this ReLU formulation for the memory update improves accuracy by another 0.5% as shown in Table~ in the last column. The final output of the memory network is passed to the answer module as in the original DMN.</p>
<h1 id="related-work">Related Work}</h1>
<p>The DMN is related to two major lines of recent work: memory and attention mechanisms. %In terms of applications, We work on both visual and textual question answering which have, until now, been developed in separate communities.</p>
<p>$ The earliest recent work with a memory component that is applied to language processing is that of memory networks (<a href="">&quot;Towards ai-complete question answering: {A} set of prerequisite toy tasks&quot;</a>) which adds a memory component for question answering over simple facts. They are similar to DMNs in that they also have input, scoring, attention and response mechanisms. However, unlike the DMN their input module computes sentence representations independently and hence cannot easily be used for other tasks such as sequence labeling. Like the original DMN, this memory network requires that supporting facts are labeled during QA training. End-to-end memory networks (<a href="">&quot;End-to-end memory networks&quot;</a>) do not have this limitation. %and we compare to their performance on the dataset ([&quot;Weston2015ToyTasks} extensively in the experiments section. In contrast to previous memory models with a variety of different functions for memory attention retrieval and representations, DMNs (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>) have shown that neural sequence models can be used for input representation, attention and response mechanisms. Sequence models naturally capture position and temporality of both the inputs and transitive reasoning steps.</p>
<p>$ Attention mechanisms allow neural network models to use a question to selectively pay attention to specific inputs. They can benefit image classification (<a href="">&quot;Deep Networks with Internal Selective Attention through Feedback Connections&quot;</a>), generating captions for images (<a href="">&quot;Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention&quot;</a>), among others mentioned below, and machine translation (<a href="">&quot;Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation,Neural machine translation by jointly learning to align and translate,Effective approaches to attention-based neural machine translation&quot;</a>). Other recent neural architectures with memory or attention which have %not been applied to language problems proposed include neural Turing machines (<a href="">&quot;Neural turing machines&quot;</a>), neural GPUs (<a href="">&quot;Neural GPUs Learn Algorithms&quot;</a>) and stack-augmented RNNs (<a href="">&quot;Inferring algorithmic patterns with stack-augmented recurrent nets&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>$ Question answering involving natural language can be solved in a variety of ways to which we cannot all do justice. If the potential input is a large text corpus, QA becomes a combination of information retrieval and extraction (<a href="">&quot;Textrunner: Open information extraction on the web&quot;</a>). Neural approaches can include reasoning over knowledge bases, ([&quot;Bordes2012,Socher2013:NTN} or directly via sentences for trivia competitions (<a href="">&quot;A Neural Network for Factoid Question Answering over Paragraphs&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>$ In comparison to QA in NLP, VQA is still a relatively young task that is feasible only now that objects can be identified with high accuracy. The first large scale database with unconstrained questions about images was introduced by (<a href="">&quot;VQA: Visual Question Answering&quot;</a>). While VQA datasets existed before they did not include open-ended, free-form questions about general images (<a href="">&quot;A Visual Turing Test for Computer Vision Systems&quot;</a>). Others are were too small to be viable for a deep learning approach (<a href="">&quot;A Multi-World Approach to Question Answering about Real-World Scenes based on Uncertain Input&quot;</a>). The only VQA model which also has an attention component is the stacked attention network (<a href="">&quot;Stacked attention networks for image question answering&quot;</a>). Their work also uses CNN based features. However, unlike our input fusion layer, they use a single layer neural network to map the features of each patch to the dimensionality of the question vector. Hence, the model cannot easily incorporate adjacency of local information in its hidden state. A model that also uses neural modules, albeit logically inspired ones, is that by (<a href="">&quot;Learning to Compose Neural Networks for Question Answering&quot;</a>) who evaluate on knowledgebase reasoning and visual question answering. We compare directly to their method on the latter task and dataset.</p>
<p>Related to visual question answering is the task of describing images with sentences (<a href="">&quot;Baby talk: Understanding and generating image descriptions&quot;</a>). (<a href="">&quot;Grounded compositional semantics for finding and describing images with sentences&quot;</a>) used deep learning methods to map images and sentences into the same space in order to describe images with sentences and to find images that best visualize a sentence. This was the first work to map both modalities into a joint space with deep learning methods, but it could only select an existing sentence to describe an image. Shortly thereafter, recurrent neural networks were used to generate often novel sentences based on images (<a href="">&quot;Deep Visual-Semantic Alignments for Generating Image Descriptions,Learning a recurrent visual representation for image caption generation,From captions to visual concepts and back,Show, attend and tell: Neural image caption generation with visual attention&quot;</a>).</p>
<h1 id="datasets">Datasets}</h1>
<p>To analyze our proposed model changes and compare our performance with other architectures, we use three datasets.</p>
<h2 id="k">-10k}</h2>
<p>For evaluating the DMN on textual question answering, we use -10k English (<a href="">&quot;Towards ai-complete question answering: {A} set of prerequisite toy tasks&quot;</a>), a synthetic dataset which features 20 different tasks. Each example is composed of a set of facts, a question, the answer, and the supporting facts that lead to the answer. The dataset comes in two sizes, referring to the number of training examples each task has: -1k and -10k. The experiments in (<a href="">&quot;End-to-end memory networks&quot;</a>) found that their lowest error rates on the smaller -1k dataset were on average three times higher than on -10k.</p>
<h2 id="daquar-all-visual-dataset">DAQUAR-ALL visual dataset}</h2>
<p>The DAtaset for QUestion Answering on Real-world images (DAQUAR) (<a href="">&quot;A Multi-World Approach to Question Answering about Real-World Scenes based on Uncertain Input&quot;</a>) consists of 795 training images and 654 test images. %, originally taken from NYU-Depth V2 dataset.Each RGBD image contains semantic segmentations where every pixel is labeled into an object class with a confidence score. Based upon these images, 6,795 training questions and 5,673 test questions were generated. %These answers are either basic colors, numbers, objects (894 categories), or sets of those. %To solve this, we add an input fusion layer similar to that of the textual input module described in Sec.~. Following the previously defined experimental method, we exclude multiple word answers (<a href="">&quot;Ask your neurons: A neural-based approach to answering questions about images,Learning to Answer Questions From Image Using Convolutional Neural Network&quot;</a>). The resulting dataset covers 90% of the original data. The evaluation method uses classification accuracy over the single words. We use this as a development dataset for model analysis (Sec. ).</p>
<h2 id="visual-question-answering">Visual Question Answering}</h2>
<p>The Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset was constructed using the Microsoft COCO dataset (<a href="">&quot;Learning to Answer Questions From Image Using Convolutional Neural Network&quot;</a>) which contained 123,287 training/validation images and 81,434 test images. Each image has several related questions with each question answered by multiple people. This dataset contains 248,349 training questions, 121,512 validation questions, and 244,302 for testing. The testing data was split into test-development, test-standard and test-challenge in (<a href="">&quot;VQA: Visual Question Answering&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>Evaluation on both test-standard and test-challenge are implemented via a submission system. test-standard may only be evaluated 5 times and test-challenge is only evaluated at the end of the competition. %In the questions, there is not only simple questions that may only require low-level computer vision knowledge, such as &quot;What color is the dog?&quot;, but also has some question requiring commonsense knowledge such as &quot;What is the mustache made o To the best of our knowledge, VQA is the largest and most complex image dataset for the visual question answering task.</p>
<h1 id="experiments">Experiments}</h1>
<h2 id="model-analysis">Model Analysis} </h2>
<p>To understand the impact of the proposed module changes, we analyze the performance of a variety of DMN models on textual and visual question answering datasets.</p>
<p>The original DMN (ODMN) is the architecture presented in (<a href="">&quot;Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing&quot;</a>) without any modifications. DMN2 only replaces the input module with the input fusion layer (Sec.~). DMN3, based upon DMN2, replaces the soft attention mechanism with the attention based GRU proposed in Sec.~. Finally, DMN+, based upon DMN3, is an untied model, using a unique set of weights for each pass and a linear layer with a ReLU activation to compute the memory update. We report the performance of the model variations in Table .</p>
<p>A large improvement to accuracy on both the -10k textual and DAQUAR visual datasets results from updating the input module, seen when comparing ODMN to DMN2. On both datasets, the input fusion layer improves interaction between distant facts. In the visual dataset, this improvement is purely from providing contextual information from neighboring image patches, allowing it to handle objects of varying scale or questions with a locality aspect. For the textual dataset, the improved interaction between sentences likely helps the path finding required for logical reasoning when multiple transitive steps are required.</p>
<p>The addition of the attention GRU in DMN3 helps answer questions where complex positional or ordering information may be required. This change impacts the textual dataset the most as few questions in the visual dataset are likely to require this form of logical reasoning. Finally, the untied model in the DMN+ overfits on some tasks compared to DMN3, but on average the error rate decreases.</p>
<p>From these experimental results, we find that the combination of all the proposed model changes results, culminating in DMN+, achieves the highest performance across both the visual and textual datasets.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-state-of-the-art-using--10k">Comparison to state of the art using -10k} </h2>
<p>We trained our models using the Adam optimizer ([&quot;kingma2014adam} with a learning rate of 0.001 and batch size of 128. Training runs for up to 256 epochs with early stopping if the validation loss had not improved within the last 20 epochs. The model from the epoch with the lowest validation loss was then selected. Xavier initialization was used for all weights except for the word embeddings, which used random uniform initialization with range <span class="math inline">\([-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3}]\)</span>. Both the embedding and hidden dimensions were of size <span class="math inline">\(d = 80\)</span>. %with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.001\)</span> for all tasks except QA6 and QA19 for which the validation set deemed no regularization was required. We used <span class="math inline">\(\ell_2\)</span> regularization on all weights except bias and used dropout on the initial sentence encodings and the answer module, keeping the input with probability <span class="math inline">\(p=0.9\)</span>. The last 10% of the training data on each task was chosen as the validation set. For all tasks, three passes were used for the episodic memory module, allowing direct comparison to other state of the art methods. Finally, we limited the input to the last 70 sentences for all tasks except QA3 for which we limited input to the last 130 sentences, similar to ([&quot;Sukhbaatar2015}.</p>
<p>On some tasks, the accuracy was not stable across multiple runs. This was particularly problematic on QA3, QA17, and QA18. To solve this, we repeated training 10 times using random initializations and evaluated the model that achieved the lowest validation set loss.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>We compare our best performing approach, DMN+, to two state of the art question answering architectures: the end to end memory network (E2E) ([&quot;Sukhbaatar2015} and the neural reasoner framework (NR) ([&quot;Peng2015}. Neither approach use supporting facts for training.</p>
<p>The end-to-end memory network is a form of memory network ([&quot;Weston2015} tested on both textual question answering and language modeling. The model features both explicit memory and a recurrent attention mechanism. We select the model from the paper that achieves the lowest mean error over the -10k dataset. This model utilizes positional encoding for input, RNN-style tied weights for the episode module, and a ReLU non-linearity for the memory update component.</p>
<p>The neural reasoner framework is an end-to-end trainable model which features a deep architecture for logical reasoning and an interaction-pooling mechanism for allowing interaction over multiple facts. While the neural reasoner framework was only tested on QA17 and QA19, these were two of the most challenging question types at the time.</p>
<p>In Table  we compare the accuracy of these question answering architectures, both as mean error and error on individual tasks. The DMN+ model reduces mean error by 1.4% compared to the the end-to-end memory network, achieving a new state of the art for the -10k dataset.</p>
<p>One notable deficiency in our model is that of QA16: Basic Induction. In ([&quot;Sukhbaatar2015}, an untied model using only summation for memory updates was able to achieve a near perfect error rate of <span class="math inline">\(0.4\)</span>. When the memory update was replaced with a linear layer with ReLU activation, the end-to-end memory network's overall mean error decreased but the error for QA16 rose sharply. Our model experiences the same difficulties, suggesting that the more complex memory update component may prevent convergence on certain simpler tasks.</p>
<p>The neural reasoner model outperforms both the DMN and end-to-end memory network on QA17: Positional Reasoning. This is likely as the positional reasoning task only involves minimal supervision - two sentences for input, yes/no answers for supervision, and only 5,812 unique examples after removing duplicates from the initial 10,000 training examples. ([&quot;Peng2015} add an auxiliary task of reconstructing both the original sentences and question from their representations. This auxiliary task likely improves performance by preventing overfitting.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-state-of-the-art-using-vqa">Comparison to state of the art using VQA} </h2>
<p>For the VQA dataset, each question is answered by multiple people and the answers may not be the same, the generated answers are evaluated using human consensus. For each predicted answer <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(i_{th}\)</span> question with target answer set <span class="math inline">\(T^{i}\)</span>, the accuracy of VQA: <span class="math inline">\(Acc_{VQA} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^Nmin(\frac{\sum_{t\in T^i}\mathds{1}_{(a_i==t)}}{3},1)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathds{1}_{(\cdot)}\)</span> is the indicator function. Simply put, the answer <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is only 100<span class="math inline">\(\%\)</span> accurate if at least 3 people provide that exact answer.</p>
<p>$ We use the Adam optimizer ([&quot;kingma2014adam} with a learning rate of 0.003 and batch size of 100. Training runs for up to 256 epochs with early stopping if the validation loss has not improved in the last 10 epochs. For weight initialization, we sampled from a random uniform distribution with range <span class="math inline">\([-0.08, 0.08]\)</span>. Both the word embedding and hidden layers were vectors of size <span class="math inline">\(d=512\)</span>. We apply dropout on the initial image output from the VGG convolutional neural network ([&quot;simonyan2014very} as well as the input to the answer module, keeping input with probability <span class="math inline">\(p=0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>The VQA dataset is composed of three question domains: Yes/No, Number, and Other. This enables us to analyze the performance of the models on various tasks that require different reasoning abilities.</p>
<p>The comparison models are separated into two broad classes: those that utilize a full connected image feature for classification and those that perform reasoning over multiple small image patches. Only the SAN and DMN approach use small image patches, while the rest use the fully-connected whole image feature approach.</p>
<p>Here, we show the quantitative and qualitative results in Table~ and Fig.~, respectively. The images in Fig.~ illustrate how the attention gate <span class="math inline">\(g^t_i\)</span> selectively activates over relevant portions of the image according to the query. In Table~, our method outperforms baseline and other state-of-the-art methods across all question domains ($) in both test-dev and test-std, and especially for $ questions, achieves a wide margin compared to the other architectures, which is likely as the small image patches allow for finely detailed reasoning over the image. %The DMN also achieves state of the art results when comparing across all question domains (All), beating out the nearest method SAN by <span class="math inline">\(1.5\%\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the granularity offered by small image patches does not always offer an advantage. The Number questions may be not solvable for both the SAN and DMN architectures, potentially as counting objects is not a simple task when an object crosses image patch boundaries.</p>
<p>%As there are no boundaries in the full connected image feature approach, they do not have this issue to contend with. %# Future Work} %Extending the DMN to handle multi-resolution image patches would likely result in further improvements in the VQA dataset. %Given that the model presented in this paper solves all but one task of the dataset, follow-up experiments may tackle new QA datasets ([&quot;Hermann2015} that have since been published.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion}</h1>
<p>We have proposed new modules for the DMN framework to achieve strong results without supervision of supporting facts. These improvements include the input fusion layer to allow interactions between input facts and a novel attention based GRU that allows for logical reasoning over ordered inputs. Our resulting model obtains state of the art results on both the VQA dataset and the -10k text question-answering dataset, proving the framework can be generalized across input domains.</p>
