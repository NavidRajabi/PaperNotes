<p>This paper presents a precursory yet novel approach to the question answering task using structural decomposition. their system first generates linguistic structures such as syntactic and semantic trees from text, de-composes them into multiple fields, then in-dexes the terms in each field. For each ques-tion, it decomposes the question into multi-ple fields, measures the relevance score ofeach field to the indexed ones, then ranks all documents by their relevance scores and weights associated with the fields, where the weights are learned through statistical modeling. their final model gives an abso-lute improvement of over 40% to the base-line approach using simple search for de-tecting documents containing answers.</p>
