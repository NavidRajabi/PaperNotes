<p>TLDR; The authors propose a novel encoder-decoder neural network architecture. The encoder RNN encodes a sequence into a fixed length vector representation and the decoder generates a new variable-length sequence based on this representation. The authors also introduce a new cell type (now called GRU) to be used with this network architecture. The model is evaluated on a statistical machine translation task where it is fed as an additional feature to a log-linear model. It leads to improved BLEU scores. The authors also find that the model learns syntactically and semantically meaningful representations of both words and phrases.</p>
<h4 id="key-points">Key Points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>New encoder-decoder architecture, seq2seq. Decoder conditioned on thought vector.</li>
<li>Architecture can be used for both scoring or generation</li>
<li>New hidden unit type, now called GRU. Simplified LSTM.</li>
<li>Could replace whole pipeline with this architecture, but this paper doesn't</li>
<li>15k vocabulary (93% of dataset cover). 100d embeddings, 500 maxout units in final affine layer, batch size of 64, adagrad, 384M words, 3 days training time.</li>
<li>Architecture is trained without frequency information so we expect it to capture linguistic information rather than statistical information.</li>
<li>Visualizations of both words embeddings and thought vectors.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questionsnotes">Questions/Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Why not just use LSTM units?</li>
