<p>TLDR: the <u>generative adversarial network(GAN)</u> was successful in <u>generating high quality samples of natural images</u>. They propose a model called composite generative adversarial network,that reveals the complex structure of images with multiple generators in which each generator generates some part of the image. GAN simultaneously trains two models: a <u>generator G</u> that tries to generate real images, and a <u>discriminator D</u> that classifies between the real images that came from the training data and the <u>fake images</u> that came from G.</p>
