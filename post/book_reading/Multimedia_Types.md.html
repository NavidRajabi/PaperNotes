<h2 id="what-is-text">What is Text?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Plain Text: American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII). Each ASCII code uses 8 bits are used to store each character.</li>
<li>Structured Text: SGML, XML, HTML./ Latex./Office Document Architecture (ODA).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-audio">What is Audio</h2>
<p>The frequency range is divided into: Human hearing frequency: 20 Hz to 20 KHz Infra-sound: 0 to 20 Hz Ultrasound: 20 KHz to 1 GHz. - Sound consists of pressure waves that move through a compressible medium. - The frequency of a sound is the reciprocal value of the period (wavelength). - Wavelength is the distance between identical points in the adjacent cycles of a waveform signal</p>
<h2 id="analogue-digital">Analogue &amp; Digital</h2>
<ul>
<li>Analog: Continuous Measure</li>
<li>Digital: Discrete Count</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digitization">Digitization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sampling: divide the horizontal axis into discrete pieces.</li>
<li>Quantization: divide the vertical axis into n levels.</li>
<li>8 bit quantization: 256 (28) levels.</li>
<li>16 bit quantization: 65536 (216) levels.</li>
<li>Simplest Digital Audio Format, is PCM.</li>
<li>For example 8-bit PCM, 8kHz.. Will be a digital stream of 8, 000 samples per sec and each sample is represented by 6 bits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digital-audio-formats">Digital Audio Formats</h2>
<h2 id="what-is-image">What is Image?</h2>
<p>Images, or pictures, are represented by bitmaps of elements. (Raster Image) A bitmap is a spatial two-dimensional matrix made up of individual picture elements called pixels.</p>
<p>Each pixel has a numerical value called amplitude. The number of bits available to code a pixel is called amplitude depth or pixel depth.</p>
<p>A pixel depth may be represented: - a black or white dot in bi-tonal images -- 1 bit/pixel - a level of gray in continuous-tone, monochromatic images - usually 8 bits/pixel - the color attributes of the picture element in colored pictures. - usually 24 bits/pixel</p>
<h2 id="digital-image-formats">Digital Image Formats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Iff, cmx, cut, kdc, pic, dxf, cdr, img, fpx, pct, cgm, lbm, hgl, pcd, mac, drw, msp, psp, psd, raw, sct, ct, ras, tif, tiff, tga, gem, clp, emf, wmf, rle, dib, wpg, dcx, pcx, ps, pdf, eps</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="digital-image-formats-1">Digital Image Formats</h2>
<h3 id="uncompressed">Uncompressed</h3>
<ul>
<li>pgm (portable grey map) or ppm (portable pixel map)</li>
<li>bmp(RIFFformat,greyandcolor)  Compressed ### GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) :</li>
<li>Uses compression algorithm LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch). Average Compression Ratio 4:1.</li>
<li>GIF87a and GIF 89a.  Animation is possible. ### JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</li>
<li>Good for photos, not very good for small image or line arts less than 100x100 pixels.  Compression ratio 10:1 to 100:1. ### PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</li>
<li>More color depth (up to 48bit) than GIF(8bit).</li>
<li>10 – 30 % smaller than LZW of GIF.  Automatic anti-alias.</li>
<li>Text based metadata can be added.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-graphics">What is Graphics?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vector Image – Mathematical descriptions of an image.</li>
<li>Graphics image formats are specified through graphics primitives and their attributes.</li>
<li>graphics primitives: lines, curves, circles</li>
<li>attributes: thickness, gray-scale, color.</li>
<li>The semantic content of graphics is preserved in the representation.</li>
<li>Example: A black line can be efficiently represented by a pair of spatial coordinates (a vector).</li>
<li>SVG, SWF, PHIGS, GKS, IGS are examples of graphics format standards.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-animation">What is Animation?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Both images and graphics may be displayed on a computer screen as a succession of views which create an impression of movement.</li>
<li>In that case, they will be referred to as video (or motion pictures) and computer animation (or motion graphics), respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-video">What is Video?</h2>
<p>Types of Analog Color Video Signals ### Component Video: Each primary color is sent in a separate video signal. - Color models used can either be RGB or a luminance-chrominance transformation of RGB. - Best color reproduction. - Require higher bandwidth and good synchronizations between the three colors.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-video-1">What is Video?</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-analog-color-video-signals">Types of Analog Color Video Signals</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Composite Video: Chrominance and luminance signals are mixed in a single carrier wave.</li>
<li>Component Video: Each component is carried in its own line. For example, R, G, B component video is carried in three lines.</li>
<li>S-Video (Separated Video): A compromise between component video and composite video. It uses two lines, one for luminance and another for a mix of two chrominance signals</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="digital-video-formats">Digital Video Formats</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>AVI: A format developed by Microsoft for storing video and audio information. AVI files are limited to 320 x 240, and 30 frame/sec.</li>
<li>QuickTime: A video and animation system developed by Apple Computer. It is built into the Macintosh operating system. QuickTime supports most encoding formats, including JPEG and MPEG.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>How do you convert a video that consist of 25 frames/sec (or 30 frames/sec) into a digital data stream?</li>
<li>One of the earlier digital attempt was called Motion-JPEG which is hardware assisted and it convert each frame into a JPEG image and does this fast enough to convert 25 JPEG images (or 30 JPEG images) within one sec. With headers, it was known as the Motion-JPEG format.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>MPEG</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>All developed by Motion Picture Experts Group; open format distributed by ISO; Joint Video Team still working on MPEG-4</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>DV/Mini-DV</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Each manufacturer has their own particular version of the format.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>RealMedia/RealVideo</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Streaming technology developed by RealNetworks for transmitting live video over the Internet.</li>
<li>RealVideo uses a variety of data compression techniques and works with both normal IP connections as well as IP Multicast connections</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multimedia-information">Multimedia Information</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Today we need to query and analyze vast amounts of multimedia data (i.e., images, sound tracks, video tracks).</li>
<li>Joint research from Database Management, Computer Vision and Signal Processing aims to solve problems related to Multimedia Information Management.</li>
<li>we cant possibly study all the different sciences, the main emphasis of this course will be on the Computer Vision &amp; Signal Processing portion , with a brief intro to the Database Management portion</li>
