<h4 id="problematic">Problematic:</h4>
<p>The paper raise the issue of exposure bias where there is gap between how the model are trained (teacher-forcing) and how they are used in test time (free running)</p>
<h4 id="contributions">Contributions:</h4>
<p>The authors propose to flip a coin at training time to either keep the <em>conditioning</em> token as is (i.e the ground truth) or replace it by the model's previous prediction (as if in test time). It's suggested to start with a high probability of keeping the ground-truth (default mode of training RNNs) and anneal that probability as the training advances following a <em>schedule</em>. The most efficient schedule in their experiments was the <em>inverse sigmoid decay</em>: <span class="math display">\[ \epsilon_i = \frac{k}{k + \exp{(i/k)}}, \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\geq 1\)</span> affects the speed of convergence and <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the current iteration.</p>
<h4 id="experiments">Experiments:</h4>
<p>Results on the tasks of image captioning, constituency parsing and speech recognition show that this approach improves over MLE with teacher-forced training.</p>
